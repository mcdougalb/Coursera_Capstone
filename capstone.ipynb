    "> After several ideas I had didn't have enough data or getting location data proved to be too hard to do. I will just do a basic one for my personal use. I want to know if there are other counties in America similar to my home. This is to see where I might like to live and work. I am looking at this as I just recently graduated from college and am looking for work. I like where I have lived growing up but the wages and job opportunities are not great unless you are a large scale farmer, a goverment employeee or a manger/owner of a business. Not great for someone just starting out on the career ladder. so moving for work is almost a given necessity for the time being."
